# Air Quality Index Project

This project leverages machine learning to monitor and visualize air quality data across multiple locations. It provides real-time updates on the Air Quality Index (AQI), enabling users to stay informed about pollution levels. 

### Key Features:
 **Real-Time AQI Updates**: Offers up-to-date AQI information for various locations, helping users stay current with air quality conditions.
 **Pollution Tracking**: Allows users to monitor pollution levels over time, providing insights into air quality trends.
 **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts for significant changes or poor air quality, ensuring users are aware of potential health impacts.
 **Historical Data Access**: Provides access to historical air quality data for comprehensive analysis and trend evaluation.

By combining machine learning with real-time and historical data, this project enhances understanding and management of air quality, supporting healthier and more informed decisions.
